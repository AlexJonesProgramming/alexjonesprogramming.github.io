				<h1>Toy Tanks</h1>
				<p>
					Toy Tanks is my first published mobile game. I spent three weeks finishing the game (though this was split up over several months due to school) and programmed everything myself using Unity Engine. The game was inspired by Wii Tanks. It is a top down puzzle/shooter in which you navigate a tank through a maze while defeating enemies. The first week of developing this game was during fall break. In this week I managed to get a playable demo done for mobile and PC which I was able to present at my school’s game conference. The second week I spent on the game was during winter break. During this week I cleaned up some of the mechanics and built a level editor so that people could build and share their levels with each other (this is not in the final game). The last week of development was done over spring break. I spent this week polishing the game mechanics, adding a new enemy time, polishing the level design, and polishing the UI. I had a lot of fun building this game and I am very proud to have published a game.

				<h1>Two Baby Gators</h1>
				<p>
					Two Baby Gators is the name of me and my friend Josh's game company. We started the company to publish a mobile game that is a twin stick shooter. The game was inspired by the 2019 "Raid area 51" meme. The player makes his way through different levels of area 51 fighting off guards and aliens to find their alien waifu and then escape the base with her. We worked on the game over that summer with an intended release on the day of the raid; sadly we both worked full time jobs and were not happy enough with the final product to publish it. Working on the game was a lot of fun, and it taught me so much about mobile development; I would have never published my first mobile game without the knowledge I gained working on this one.

				<h1>Doughnut Chess</h1>
				<p>
					This is a networked chess game that was inspired by a lecture in my artificial intelligence class. The game is played on a doughnut shaped board and has all of the same rules as chess, save for a few exceptions. Pieces can move freely from what would be one side of the board to the other; there is no end to the board so there is no pawn promotion, and you are not allowed to castle your king. I spent two days working on this game, the first to get a local version of the game working, and a second to add the movement highlighting as well as the networking component. The networking is simple C# TCP socket programming and hosting a game does require port forwarding in most cases. I had a lot of fun working on this; it was my first networking experience outside of my education and I really enjoyed the freedom to do network programming with no constraints.

				<h1>Bug Game</h1>
				<p>
					This game was a school game jam project, made with a team of eight people (five programmers and three artists). The topic of the game jam was "It's not a bug it's a feature.” Over dinner, the group came up with several ideas and landed on the idea that a restaurant was cooking bugs into the food on purpose. In the game, the player runs through a 2D platformer and kills and collects bugs. After the platformer level is complete, the player then plays a rhythm game where they chop up the bugs to add to the food. This game jam was a lot of fun; we used git to collaborate on this game, and with a lot of people being new to git, it was a good learning experience in that area. My role in this game’s production was to help any programmers that had any problems (as I was the most experienced with Unity Engine) as well as make sure everything (such as design changes, or which art assets were needed next) was communicated to everyone properly.

				<h1>Intel Intrinsics</h1>
				<p>
					This is a collection of my lab work for my optimization class. I have four separate labs here, each using intel intrinsics to perform several operations in parallel to speed up the application. All of these labs will have an optimized and unoptimized time listed if you run them. The first lab adjusts the brightness of an image, the second lab adds an echo to an audio file, the third lab doubles the tempo of an audio file by removing every other beat, and the last converts a TGA file to a BMP.

				<h1>Open GL</h1>
				<p>
					This is all the work from my second graphics programming class. In the class, we learned to display 3D models using openGL and GLSL, as well as program things such as terrain/object collision, animation, UI, and 3D audio. We used everything we learned in this class to build a simple game. The game was originally going to be a rhythm game played with the arrow keys, but when animation was required we changed it to be a helicopter game in which the player has to make it through the rings in a specific amount of time. There were two of us working on this project over the course of a semester, though we both implemented all of the features on our own before working together to make something better. This was a sophomore level class, so I am not super proud of the code, but it stands to show the progress I have made over the course of my education.
